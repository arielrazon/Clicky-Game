## What is “Clicky Game” ?

Clicky Game is a react-based memory game with theming based on NBC's "The Good Place". 

It was uploaded to github-pages using the gh-pages NPM package.

## Functionality/Usage

1. Upon loading, the user will see a grid of components with images of "The Good Place" characters.
2. To play, the user must not click the same card twice within the same round of gameplay. 
3. The user's points/streak will increase with each click that doesn't correspond to an already-clicked gameplay component.
4. If the user clicks an already-clicked component, they will "lose" and their score will reset.
